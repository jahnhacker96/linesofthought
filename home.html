<p>Hi, I'm Jeanette Ahn. In this collection, I've curated some of my favorite pieces of art, architecture, and sculpture from throughout art history.</p>
<p>Art history is the study of visual art over time, exploring how cultural, social, and historical factors shape its evolution.</p> <p>I've also included my personal reflections on why these works resonate with me and their significance within the broader context of art history.</p>
