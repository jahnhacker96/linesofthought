        <span class="caption">Sainte-Chapelle is a palatine chapel that was built by Louis IX to house the Crown of Thorns. Louis IX was king of France who was considered a saint during his lifetime and was canonized by the Catholic church after his death (1). I like this chapel due to its usage of stained glass that creates an ephemeral experience.</span>

        <span class="caption"> Alhambra of Granada are medieval palaces that were built by Nasrid dynasty rulers, who were the last of the Muslims to rule Spain. These palaces are known for their decorative architecture along with its fountains and gardens (2). I like this architecture because of how decorative its architecture is along its walls and ceilings with the Quranic script that can be breathtaking to see.</span>

        <span class="caption"> St. Peter’s Basilica is built to house the remains of St. Peter resides below its floor level. This building has a complex history in terms of its construction as it used to be a chariot racing stadium before it was converted into a basilica by Constantine. There were several notable architects who worked on this building such as Michelangelo and Bernini (3).I like this architecture because its interior is breathtaking with its usage of domes.</span>

        <span class="caption">Angkor Wat is a Hindu temple and is one of the best preserved temples in the world. It is the magnum opus of  Khmer empire that means to duplicate the idea of heavens on earth (4). I like this temple because it shows the architectural prowess that can be often overlooked by its Western counterparts.</span>

        <span class="caption">Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright is considered Wright’s magnum opus. The client commissioned Wright to build their summer home for a weekend retreat due to their shared love for nature (5). I like this architecture because of how it is integrated with the waterfall.</span>

This temple was constructed in the Goryeo dynasty and is known for its unique location of being built along the shore line (6).

        <span class="caption">Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque is a secular building with a complex history. It was initially built as a cathedral when Istanbul was Constantinople and then converted into a mosque when Constantinople collapsed before finally converting to a museum for secular use (7). I like this architecture because it showcases how the architecture shifts in relation to he political landscape and preserves them.</span>

        <span class="caption">Mezquita of Córdoba, Mezquita-Cathedral, is one of the oldest structures that Muslims have built that is still standing in Spain. This building has a complex history as a religious site. It is thought to have been a temple to Janus in the Roman era, which was then converted to church and then converted to mosque before being converted back to church again (8). I like this architecture because it shows how the religious sites from different religions come together.</span>
